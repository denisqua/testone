## Bug Fixes

- Fixed a crash that could occur when launching a hunt with a party member who had the Predator cell or perk active.

- Fixed a crash that could occur during combat.

- Fixed a bug that could cause cells to be lost or duplicated when moving them between gear.

- Fixed a bug where interrupts weren't counting toward Mastery progression.



## KNOWN ISSUES 

- Previewing repeaters in certain screens (e.g. Hunt Pass, store) will not display active parts. Only default parts will be visible.

- Slayers are unable to reach Behemoth Mastery Rank 50.

- Critical hit FX indicators can become orphaned and not clean themselves up properly. This appears as a number of glowing orange '^' shapes on the screen.

- The Discipline cell shows a Technique icon, even though it's actually a Power cell.

- Furious Axecore (axe mod) and Turbine Trigger (hammer mod) display the wrong icons.

- Players may see the friend/party invite alert ("!") even if they don't have a pending invite.

- Some players may experience higher-than-usual CPU usage in certain situations.
